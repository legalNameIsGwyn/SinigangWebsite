    <h2>Greenhouse Gases Emissions</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>Gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). The "greenhouse effect," or warming that happens when the atmosphere traps heat radiation from the Earth that is radiating toward space, is what scientists believe is responsible for the trend in global warming that has been seen since the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Energy from the Sun is necessary for life to exist on Earth. Nearly half of the light energy that reaches the Earth's atmosphere is reflected and radiated as infrared heat as it travels through the atmosphere and clouds to the surface. About 90% of this heat is absorbed by greenhouse gases and radiated again, slowing heat loss to space.</p>
    <p>The five significant greenhouse gases that contribute to the Greenhouse effect are Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), including Water Vapor.</p>

    <h2>Manmade Activities</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>Fossil fuels like coal and oil have increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere over the past century. This rise occurs due to the coal or oil process of combustion, which merges carbon with oxygen present in the air to produce CO2. The clearing of land for industrial, agricultural, and other anthropogenic activities has, to a lesser extent, yielded an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
    <p>Since 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased by almost 50% due to the industrial activities on which modern civilization depended. Scientists can see a distinct isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere, indicating that human activities cause this increase.</p>
    <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, comprised of scientific experts from all over the world, concluded in its Sixth Assessment Report that the increase in CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is unequivocally the result of human activities, and that human influence is the primary driver of many observed changes from across atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.</p>
