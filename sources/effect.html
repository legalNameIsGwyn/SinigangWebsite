    <h1>Effects of Global Warming</h1>
</div>

<div class="EffectContent">
    <h2>Increased Sea level</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>The Philippines' sea levels are rising at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. Due to higher sea levels, storm surges of up to 15-20 feet can occur when powerful storms, like Typhoon Haiyan, hit land.</p>
    <p>A total of 14% of people and 42% of coastal residents are predicted to be impacted by storm surges. Insecure infrastructure, restricted clean water access, and a lack of health insurance put informal settlements, which account for 45% of the Philippines' urban population, especially vulnerable to flooding.</p>

    <h2>Raised temperature</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>The global average surface temperature rises as concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase. The last ten years, from 2011 to 2020, have been the warmest ever recorded. Each decade since the 1980s has indeed been warmer than that of the preceding one. Hot weather and heat waves are becoming more common across nearly all land areas. Heat-related illnesses become more common as temperatures rise, making outdoor work tricky. When environments are hotter, forest fires begin quite easily and spread more quickly. The Arctic has heated up at least twice as quickly as the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Temperatures in the Philippine oceans have risen by 4-5 degrees Celsius above average. Coral reefs are harmed by warmer waters, which may cause fish populations to decline and endanger food security. According to research, a healthy coral reef that has not been damaged can support a yearly harvest of 15-20 tonnes of reef fish, whereas a reef that has been damaged can only support 4-5 tonnes.</p>

    <h2>Increased Drought</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>Drought conditions have led to increased wildfires, which are thought to be made worse because of changing climate and El Nino. These fires destroyed large forest areas between 2000 and 2006, amounting to approximately 15,700 hectares. In addition, it has been shown that the propagation of invasive plants and insects in natural systems is correlated with the elevated temperatures and humidity in these areas.</p>

    <h2>Health risks</h2>
    <hr attribute="value">
    <p>Changing climate is the single most serious health threat confronting humanity. Climate change is already causing health problems through disease, air pollution, extreme weather conditions, displacement of force, mental health strains, and increased hunger and malnutrition throughout areas where individuals cannot grow or find enough food. Environmental variables claim the lives of approximately 13 million individuals each year. Weather patterns are changing, and extreme weather conditions are increasing deaths and making it challenging for healthcare systems to maintain pace.</p>
    <p>Rainfall and increasing temperatures both aid mosquito growth and survival; as a result, health effects from mosquito-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dengue fever, and malaria are expected to escalate. Even though malaria rates have decreased significantly over the years, dengue epidemics continue to occur every 3-4 years, as well as diarrhea, was the fifth leading cause of death in 2010.</p>
