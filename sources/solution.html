  <h2>Mitigation</h2>
  <hr attribute="value">
  <p>This is through the reduction of emissions and stabilization of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere in order to prevent warming to more extreme temperatures.</p>
  <p>Ways to mitigate climate change are to reduce the source of greenhouse gasses such as from burning of fossil fuels or by enhancing and preserving natural carbon sinks (oceans, forests, soil). Therefore, stopping deforestation and the continuous efforts of restoration of natural resources and habitats enable us to attain homeostasis within the environment.</p>
  <p>From the 2014 report on Mitigation of Climate Change from the United Nations, the goal of mitigation is to avoid significant human interference with the Earth’s climate, “stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”</p>

  <h2>Adaptation</h2>
  <hr attribute="value">
  <p>Through altering our daily behavior, systems and ways of life in order to protect the environment and the people around us from the impacts of climate change.</p>
  <p>The goal of adaptation is to reduce risks from the harmful effects of climate change to the environment such as extreme weather events (extreme drought,intense flood, and sea-level rises) or harm to food security. Adaptation also encourages us to find and create opportunities that climate change may provide such as enhanced farming productivity through long growing seasons.</p>
  <p>Adaptation solutions vary from across the globe however, understanding local risks and developing plans can help manage climate change.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Investing in renewable energy</strong> is one of the best ways to stop using fossil fuels such as utilizing solar, wind, wave, geothermal energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Switch to commuter transportation</strong> in order to reduce car use or switch to electric vehicles in order to reduce carbon emissions. Minimizing plane travel can also help reduce air pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Reducing plastic use</strong> because plastic use is carbon-intensive and it doesn’t break down quickly in nature — therefore, a lot of plastic is burned releasing carbon.</li>
  </ul>
